# Introduction

- Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and others can generate images, sometimes beautiful ones, given only a prompt.
- Diffusion models are becoming a foundation for cutting-edge research in life sciences and other sectors as well. For example, they are used in generating molecules for drug discovery. So, when you understand the technical details of diffusion models, you'll be in a better position to understand and perhaps apply these models yourself.
