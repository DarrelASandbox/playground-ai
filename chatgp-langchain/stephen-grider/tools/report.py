"""
This module contains a utility for writing HTML content to a file. 
It leverages the StructuredTool class from the langchain.tools module 
to create a tool that can be integrated into langchain workflows. 

The primary function 'write_report' is designed to write HTML content to a specified file,
which is particularly useful for generating and saving reports in HTML format. 

The 'WriteReportArgsSchema' class is a Pydantic model that defines the schema for 
the arguments required by the 'write_report' function. 
This ensures structured and validated input when the function is
used as a tool in the langchain framework.

Function:
- write_report: Writes HTML content to a file on disk.

Class:
- WriteReportArgsSchema: Pydantic model for validating arguments passed to the 'write_report' function.

Usage:
The 'write_report_tool' can be used in any system where there is a need to generate
and save HTML reports, especially when used in conjunction with other langchain tools and agents.
