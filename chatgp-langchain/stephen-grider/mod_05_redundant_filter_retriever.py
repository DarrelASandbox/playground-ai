"""
This module defines a custom retriever class for document retrieval, 
which is part of a larger language processing framework.

The RedundantFilterRetriever class extends the base retriever functionality with
specific logic for handling redundant information.

It utilizes embeddings to transform queries into a numerical format and 
employs a Chroma vector store for efficient document retrieval.

This custom retriever is designed to filter out irrelevant or 
redundant information from the search results, 
improving the relevance of the retrieved documents.

Classes:
- RedundantFilterRetriever: A custom retriever that extends BaseRetriever from langchain.schema.
It uses embeddings and Chroma vector store for document retrieval and 
applies a max marginal relevance algorithm to filter out redundant information.

Usage:
The RedundantFilterRetriever can be used in any system where efficient and 
relevant document retrieval is required, particularly in language processing and 
information retrieval applications.
